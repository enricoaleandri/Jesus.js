#Jesus.js
Not sure what will it do yet. But it just sounds like a really powerful library no matter what it does.

## Run it
run for setup:
```
npm install
```
run for test :
```
npm test
```


##API

	//Create the instance of Jesus ( no more Jesus will exists )  and is not required NEW for let born the Son of God.
